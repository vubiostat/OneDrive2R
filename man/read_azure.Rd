\title{Read data in a file from Azure OneDrive to memory}
\usage{
read_azure(drive, path, FUN = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{drive}{A pointer to an ms_drive object from \code{Microsoft365R}}

\item{path}{The path to the file. See details.}

\item{FUN}{The function to read the data into memory. The default will make a guess of supported type from the filename extension.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments to pass to the function that reads the data into memory.}
}
\value{
An R object containing the requested data.
}
\description{
This function given a path will read a file that was shared or owned directly
into memory. This is important if the file contains information
that one doesn't want stored to disk, e.g. private health information (PHI)
or private identifiable information (PII).
}
\details{
Unfortunately, if one accesses a OneDrive file via the file system it will
copy the file locally and switch it to 'sync' mode. To get rid of the file
requires a manual removal and turning off 'sync' mode.

The path can be difficult to find. If one navigates to the data file to read
in SharePoint (the web interface to OneDrive) and clicks the \dots next to
the file name, the bottom most menu item is 'Details'. Clicking this and
another interface opens to the right and the bottom most right corner has
a 'More Details' option. Clicking on that will bring up more options and
there exists a 'Path' option with a double square next to it to copy
the path to the clipboard. The path it copies will not be the correct
path--it will contain additional directories (usually about 3) that need
to be removed before using. In the examples below the path returned was
'/personal/shawn_garbett_vumc_org/Documents/CQS\%20Cloud\%20Team/Project\%20Artifacts/def.csv',
which needs to be shortened and '\%20' replaced with space to result 'CQS Cloud Team/Project Artifacts/def.csv'.

Another option is to use the share URL. See \code{\link{link_path}}.

One can see the top level directories one
owns from \code{\link{owned_azure}} or shared \code{\link{shared_azure}}.
